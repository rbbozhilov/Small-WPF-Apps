# Gym

The idea for this app is taken from a real fitness app. This is a WPF desktop application that can add new clients by registering them under two names and automatically generates a unique number. Once this number is given to the client, the next time he comes, he says either the number or both names, and the application finds it and shows from when to when his fitness card was paid. If the card has expired, it can be renewed using the edit button and the new start date and end date are entered.All clients are saved in database.
